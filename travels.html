  <h1>Places I would like to visit</h1>
  <p>I've took my first trip to a different city in 2016. I went to Houston, Texas.
    I left on a Friday afternoon after work. I took the blue line to O'Hare airport and
    I waited for my flight departure time. This was the first time I flew and it was a great
    experience that motivated me to consider traveling. Here is a list of the cities I would like to visit.</p>
    <div class="citybuttons">
    <button>Paris, France</button>
    <button>London, England</button>
    <button>Madrid, Spain</button>
    <button>Tokyo, Japan</button>
    <button>Sydney, Australia</button>
    <button>Los Angeles, California, USA</button>
