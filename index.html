  <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
  <div class="intro">
  <p>This site is a work in progress. I am learning how to create web pages using HTML5 markup.
  So far, I've been learning a great deal and I am enjoying this class.
  The first part of this project is to create three pages with navigation links.
  One of the pages must be your resume. The other page can contain any media.
  I've decided to include a world map. I would like to list the trips that I would like to take.
  One of my goals this upcoming summer is to get my motorcycle license. I would like to learn how to ride.
  Once I achive my goal, this would be the motorcycle I would like to own.</p>
